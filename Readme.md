## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Download or clone the project and place it inside your `htdocs` folder (`C:\xampp\htdocs`).
2. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** using the XAMPP control panel.
3. Create a MySQL database named `belleville-dental` using **phpMyAdmin**.
4. Import the provided SQL file to populate the database.
5. Open a browser and go to:
   `http://localhost/belleville-dental`

## Default Admin Credentials

```bash
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

> Be sure to change these credentials in a real-world deployment for security purposes.

---

## Configuration

Database connection settings can be found in:

* `includes/config.php`
* `admin/includes/config.php`

By default, they assume a standard XAMPP installation:

```php
$dbUsername = "root";
$dbPassword = ""; // leave empty if no password
```

> If your MySQL setup uses a password, be sure to update these files.
