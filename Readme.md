# Belleville Dental - Educational Article Website

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Belleville Dental project! This is a complete, functional website built for a fictional
dental clinic. It is a practical example of a classic dynamic website powered by PHP and
a MySQL database. The project is divided into two main parts: a client side where
visitors can learn about the clinic and read articles, and an administration side for
managing most of the site's content.

A typical visitor can browse the site, read news articles, and search for specific topics. An
administrator, on the other hand, can log in to a private backend, view site statistics, write and
publish new articles, manage categories, and moderate user comments, feedbacks, products all through
an intuitive user interface.

A quick note on configuration: The database connection settings are stored in `includes/config.php` and

is `root` with no password. If your MySQL setup uses a password, you must update this file.
